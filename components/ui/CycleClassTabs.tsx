              <strong>2) Will I get a bicycle of my height?</strong>
              <p>Yes, absolutely! Before confirming your session, we&apos;ll ask for your height so we can arrange a bicycle that&apos;s the right fit for you. Once you arrive at the venue, our trainers will adjust the seat height and make any necessary adjustments to ensure you&apos;re comfortable and ready to learn with confidence.</p>
            </div>

              <strong>3) What is the duration of each session?</strong>
              <p>Each session will last an hour. In case you are late and we have a session later, your session will be cut short.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <strong>4) How many sessions do I need to learn cycling properly?</strong>

              <strong>5) Do you offer trial sessions?</strong>

            </div>
            <div>
              <strong>6) Is there a guarantee that I will learn cycling?</strong>
              <p>Our experienced trainers have successfully taught 500+ beginners to ride a bicycle with confidence. With personalized guidance, patience, and regular practice, we&apos;ll support you throughout your learning journey until you&apos;re able to ride independently.</p>
